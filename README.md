# under-construction Website
Shared under construction HTML file.
I found this free template that I use when I am doing maintenance or backups of my servers.

I run a dedicated Apache web server full-time for this site only, and when performing backups, maintenance, 
or if my web servers go down,
I change my DNS rules to point to this site while it is down, and then point 
DNS rules back to the production web server is back up and running.

Here is an example of what it looks like.

Feel free to download this html file and customize it to your needs.
You can edit the file via any text editor, i use Visual Studio Code.
and you can change this to say coming soon or under maintenance for example.

I gave you a choice of a coming soon or a maintenance site. Just copy and paste the line you need and the images are already in the zip file.
be sure to edit line 17 on the img src "images/maintenance.png" or "images/coming.png"
have fun.
